bot_simulation
==============

A simulation of 'bots' which collect items with some simple rules:

* Each bot can collect 1 item at a time
* If a bot collides with another item, he drops the item and inverses his direction
* If a bot collides with another bot, he inverses his direction

After some time, the items will be accumulated in certain areas.
(some insects work like this to gather food)
